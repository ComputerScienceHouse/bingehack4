NetHack 4 is licensed under the the NetHack General Public License
(see libnethack/dat/license for the license terms). The license is
similar to old versions of the GPL (both the GPL and the NHGPL were
based on the same license, the BISON general public license).

Additionally, some of the newer files in the repository offer a choice
of license; they can be distributed under the terms of the NHGPL, but
additionally, can also be distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License (or GPL), version 2 or later. If a file offers
this choice of license, that fact will be specified in a comment in
the file itself. If you plan to redistribute or modify these
dual-licensed files, you can follow the terms of either or both
licenses, at your option. You can find a copy of version 2 of the GPL
as libnethack/dat/gpl.

Please note:

NetHack 4 DOES NOT COME WITH ANY SORT OF WARRANTY.

    /* KMH, role patch -- Variables used during startup. If the user wishes to
       select a role, race, gender, and/or alignment during startup, the
       choices should be recorded here.  This might be specified through
       command-line options, environmental variables, a popup dialog box,
       menus, etc. These values are each an index into an array.  They are not
       characters or letters, because that limits us to 26 roles. They are not
       booleans, because someday someone may need a neuter gender.  Negative
       values are used to indicate that the user hasn't yet specified that
       particular value. If you determine that the user wants a random choice,
       then you should set an appropriate random value; if you just left the
       negative value, the user would be asked again! These variables are
       stored here because the u structure is cleared during character
       initialization, and because the flags structure is restored for saved
       games.  Thus, we can use the same parameters to build the role entry for 
       both new and restored games. These variables should not be referred to
       after the character is initialized or restored (specifically, after
       role_init() is called). */
